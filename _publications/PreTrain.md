title: "Can Semantic Labels Assist Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/PretrainedModel
excerpt: ' In this paper, we defend the usefulness of semantic labels but point out that fully-supervised and self-supervised methods are pursuing different kinds of features. To alleviate this issue, we present a new algorithm named Supervised Contrastive Adjustment in Neighborhood (SCAN) that maximally prevents the semantic guidance from damaging the appearance feature embedding.'
